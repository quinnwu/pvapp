For the duration of the competition, teams develop their MVP or a new feature for their product with the help of outstanding mentors, dedicated engineering development resources, and over $20,000 in cash and development prizes.'),(2,'I just submitted for the Wharton Business Plan Competition. Can I submit my idea to Pennvention?','A Pennvention submission must have some sort of technological innovation that has not yet been implemented in existing products. If your idea also has some sort of business model innovation (an commerce model, for example), that is awesome but certainly not required.'),(3,'What if my project idea is not for-profit?','Pennvention is excited to accept non-profit and civic projects this year, in addition to for-profit projects. Even if you don’t have a profitable business model, remember that you must explain how your idea will need to be sustainable in order to advance in the competition.'),(4,'Is this competition only for hardware?','The competition is open to all types of technology innovation, including hardware, software, biotech, consumer products, applied materials science, and similar areas. However, we select Semifinalists and Finalists based on the merit of their innovation.'),(5,'Can I submit my webapp idea?','As a tech innovation competition, Pennvention certainly welcomes any sort of software (whether a desktop, mobile, or web application) for a project submission. However, we caution those teams to make sure that they have a particular, novel innovation that has not been implemented in similar products before, and cannot be easily duplicated. Do you use a unique algorithm or integrate a hardware extension into your app? Or is your webapp a data analytics platform with a particularly new way of analyzing information? Questions like these can help ensure that you have integrated a novel technological innovation into your webapp.'),(6,'Is this open to non-Penn students?','Unfortunately, we are only open to project teams with at least one Penn student.');

Competitive advantage?\r\nIt is not clear in the video how wearing the device will be helpful to manage the stress and \'live longer\'. \r\nThe implementation plan is reasonable for the $5000 prize.',7.33333),(43,227,93,8,5,7,'Nice video.\r\nIt is an interesting concept but could there be any reason why Apple decided not to allow interfacing with third-party apps? It is not clear what aspect of the proposed app is patentable. What is your competitive advantage?\r\nThe implementation plan sounds reasonable although it is not clear how sponsoring hackaton is relevant. \r\nOverall, a nice app, but less of unique innovation.',6.66667),(44,227,6,8,6,7,'Nice video. Nice value proposition.\r\nIt is not clear how the product is patentable. What is unique about the product? How is it safe? The video mentions that the product consists of a sensor unit and a patch, but how does it by itself allow monitoring of the temperature \'anywhere in the world\'? The technical part of the presentation needs to be strengthened. \r\nThe general implementation plan is presented although it is not clear how $5000 will help \'finalize\' the product. It should cost more than $5000 to finalize the development. Also, you may want to check in advance if FDA will consider the product a medical device.',7),(45,301,63,9,7,7,'Awesome job. How much would the devices cost?',7.66667),(46,246,44,8,7,9,'Very impressed by this product and how far along the product has already been develped. But how will funding from pennvention help your team. It seems like you guys already have things under control. All in all a great product and I really hope to see you guys succeed. ',8),(47,246,28,6,8,7,'The idea is a great one and it does seem like there is truly innovation that has been made. However, the presentation is technical to a certain degree and is rather hard to understand for those who don\'t have the technical understanding. Especially the sensitivity analysis slides, which are no doubt important, but the information could have been made more understandable. Furthermore, future plans can be expanded. Great product!',7),(48,246,6,8,8,6,'Overall an amazing product that I think will definitely have a place in the market and hopefully a prominent place! It would have been nice to get more information on the implementation and also the hurdles that your team faces moving forward!',7.33333),(49,250,71,5,7,8,'The presentation needs the most work - only one team member is visible as a participant in it, and the link between the problem statement and the invention as the best solution is fairly weak. The plan, particularly how detailed it was with respect to the $5000 grand prize usage, was quite good. Working prototype is also encouraging.',6.66667),(50,250,36,7,7,8,'Presentation had a little technical glitch at the end. I assume it\'s a one-person team, but was unsure. Innovation seems well vetted and unique. Clearly identified problem to solve and how this is the best solution. Nothing on the structure of the IP agreement with the company that owns the technology, so I did not give a full score for this reason. The plan was well along - great job going out and getting HSCI to give you this much feedback. The explanation for what the use of proceeds are for Pennvention specifically was a little weak as it seems you have access to quite a few other resources. I did not award full score for this reason. Great idea overall - good luck!',7.33333),(51,250,42,9,10,7,'Very effective demonstration of the technology in the presentation. Good job showing the uniqueness of the algorithm and describing the development of the output. Clear link between the market need and the innovation served up as the solution. Plan is somewhat weak - I do not have a good understanding of the timeline or the funding/costs required. However, you did explain what you would use the grand prize funding for.',8.66667),(52,250,47,8,10,9,'This was a very well organized and well done presentation. Good mix of slides and product images to face-to-face presentation. The second inventor was not involved, so full score was not given for this reason.  The prototype visual, examples of types of hits and explanation of the accelerometer algorithm were excellent. Clearly a differentiated solution that has a solid link to the problem statement. Full score on innovation - really a great job articulating that in this presentation. Good job explaining use of proceeds and timeline for the testing in the fall. Good luck!',9);
