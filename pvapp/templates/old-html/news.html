	<h3><a href="http://biocellection.com">BioCellection</a></h3>

BioCellection upcycles recyclable plastic waste into valuable compound rhamnolipid for textiles using genetically engineered bacteria. This invention has the potential to clean plastic pollution around the world, disrupt the textiles industry, and grow into a $100MM business in 5 years.

This way, the user can have a truly hands-free pumping session and focus on what she cares about while pumping: working, being productive on her phone, or just relaxing. The Lilu compression bra increases the efficiency, output, and comfort of breast pumping for working mothers and mothers with concerns about their breast milk supply so they can reach their breastfeeding goals. </p>
	<h3><a href="http://juntosalimos.org">JuntoSalimos</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://xeedlimits.com">XEED</a></h3>
	<p>XEED accelerates physical therapy for those with degenerative movement disorders by enabling therapists to monitor exactly how their patients move throughout the day and to provide personalized recommendations. XEED is a network of one to four wearable devices that are worn on the wrists and ankles. They capture the motion of each limb and sync the data to a smartphone where it is compared against benchmarks set by the therapist. With XEED, therapists and patients can work together outside the clinic to understand the specific needs to maintain effective rehabilitation in between monthly therapy sessions. This enhanced guidance helps patients understand their present capabilities, equipping them with the knowledge to expand them. The XEED team will work with research foundations and use the collected data to unravel the mysteries behind movement disorders and to contribute to the development of a diagnostic test and cure for diseases like Parkinson's. XEED helps you understand your limits so you can never stop trying to exceed them. </p>

	<h3><a href="http://fermento.squarespace.com">Fermento</a></h3>
	<p>Fermento has innovated, patented, and applied an existing Penn's proprietary droplet-maker technology to speed up the production process used by the $520 billion global beer industry to make beer. Fermentation is a significant bottleneck in beer production as yeast takes up to three weeks to convert sugar liquid into alcohol into a batch reactor setting. Through microfluidic-based production, Fermento can speed up fermentation by up to 9 times that of existing batch reactors while maintaining alcohol quality and composition at an industrial scale. Faster beer production can lead to substantial cost reductions and supply and profit growth for large-scale beer manufacturers, as well as smaller microbreweries. </p>
	<h3><a href="http://innamed.com">InnaMed</a></h3>
	<p>The body tells an evolving story every day, and it doesn't make sense that people don't have access to every page of this story. When you can't follow a story, you lose interest. This is dangerous as our health is one of the most important stories of our lives. At InnaMed, we're opening up that story by creating the gateway to personalized healthcare. With only one drop of blood required and without needing to visit a lab, our home blood testing device allows you to painlessly track the same important health indicators that doctors use to assess your overall health. Since the results are stored on your device, for the first time, you can track your personal health over time, identify problems as they emerge (along with steps to solve them), and send results to your local doctor. </p>
